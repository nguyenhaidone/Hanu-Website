Prerequisites
Website: Truong dai hoc Ha Noi.
Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements:
* You should run html file with lastest Chrome ,Firefox,.. vision but i think you shouldn't run
html file with Safari because i didn't currently optimize for Safari :( This is my fault.
* You must run this files in localhost :((another my fault, i just found this bug when i write readme file))
.If you are using VSCode, you can install LiveServer extension, or if you are using Sublime Text 3, you can 
install BrowserSync. You just run index.html or /html/index.html in localhost.
I'll try fix this bug as soon as possible.

How to run:
* With VSCode: after you installed LiveServer, right click index.html or /html/index.html,choose "Open with
LiveServer" or Alt+L Alt+O.
* With Sublime: after you installed BrowserSync, choose BrowserSync at Navbar, choose "Launch".I think you must
move index.html or /html/index.html file before you Launch.

Some problems maybe you encounter:
* After you resize(or you wanna test responsive web design), you set normal size and somethings be hide.You can
reload browser.

Iâ€™m sorry for the inconvenience. I'll fix bugs as soon as possible. Plz support to me. Thank you soo much!
